Subway Data Analysis

Introduction 

The NYC public transportantion system - Metro Transit Authority - provides data for download via csv files. Part of the information available are data from the subway turnstiles, containing weekly logs for cumulative entries and exits by turnstile and by subway station during a provided timeframe. For this project, we will only use the information available at: http://web.mta.info/developers/turnstile.html.
